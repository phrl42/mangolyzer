# Banana Game Engine

This is an experimental game engine which I personally use to learn about graphics and game development

I have been inspired by <a href="https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel">Cherno</a> in terms of abstraction.

# Running

Generate makefiles

```premake5 gmake2```

Compile

```make```

Run visualizer

```bin/target/Debug/Sandbox/Sandbox```

# Info

You should press the key "u" in order to switch between modes.

In order to verify the workings of this visualizer you might have to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK2rmLE7mFw">this song</a> whilst running. This program does not come with any warranty nor liability.
